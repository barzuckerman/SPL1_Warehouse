# Food Warehouse Management System

## Overview
This project aims to design an object-oriented system to simulate a food warehouse management system in C++. 
The system will leverage classes, standard data structures, and unique C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”, handling memory in C++ efficiently and avoiding memory leaks.

## System Description

In SPLand, a war has been ongoing for several months. 
Citizens have come together to establish a food warehouse to support each other. The warehouse is operated by volunteers with different roles, handling orders made by customers. 
The simulation includes the following components:

Volunteers: Assigned to various roles to manage the warehouse.
Customers: Place orders for food packages.
Orders: Managed and processed by volunteers.
